    <h1>Art is essential human expression, it can breathe meaning into the world around us and illuminate ideas and thoughts that would otherwise remain invisible.</h1>

    <h2>I am interested in Art negotiating the space between reality and abstraction, how it can force us to look at the world through new eyes and reveal hidden truths.</h2> 
    <h3>Art that represents the world with great fidelity can be a demonstration great technical skill but the more accurately the world is resolved, the less space there is for provoking imagination. Photography has largely replaced art in this aspect.</h3>
    <h4>The closer Art comes to pure abstraction, the more space there is to dream, imagine and interpret but the less confidence we have in the meaning, instincts and drive of the author.</h4>    
    <h5>It’s in the realm between representation of reality and it’s disintegration into pure abstraction that we can find interpretations, expanded imagination and tensions, challenging questions and provocations.</h5>    
    <h6>This the space I want to explore.</h6>
